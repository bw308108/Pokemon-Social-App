# Pokemon-Social-App

For this web application, I used Flask as the framework, elephantsql for the database, and PokeAPI for the third-party api. 


The web application allows the user to create an account. Once an accouunt is created, the user can post pictures of their favorite pokemon using a url from the web.
The user can also add captions and see what other users post on their account the feed page.

If the user is unfamiliar with Pokemon, that is no problem. The user can search for any pokemon using the pokemon name or number. Once the user has searched
for the pokemon, a few stats about the pokemon will be displayed.

The user then can use the information to create a post about a pokemon.
